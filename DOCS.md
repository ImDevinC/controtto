## Uncommon pairs
Uncommon pairs refer to trading pairs that involve combinations of asset types that are less typical or less frequently traded in the market. These pairs may not align with standard trading conventions or practical use cases. For example, pairing "Crypto" with "Stock" might be considered uncommon because such combinations are not widely supported or logical in most trading systems.
